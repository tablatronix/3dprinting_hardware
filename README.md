repo for 3dpriner hardware configurations


I currently run a Creality Ender3 Pro with a BTT SKR E3 mini v2.

I just octopi/octoprint on a raspi B+

I just migrated from marlin to klipper on a creality sonic pad

My printer has some custom enclosure controls, rgb, led lighting, and controller power control
